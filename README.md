## Development

This portfolio was built with react and uses several node modules to create a sleek and cohesive portfolio that displays my skills as a developer, 
the web app itself looks clean and polished and displays any information an employer may need while looking for information on me. I tried to add as much personal touch to it as I could while taking some inspiration from others who have amazing work. Bootstrap made clean easy layouts possible and small tweaks in a css file made it easy to get the desired look. It is meant to be a single page application. 

## Info

This build went through alot of refactoring as I couldn't quite land on the design that I wanted while still meeting the criteria of the assignment. I was able to find a focused layout to shoot for and implement it with little trouble once I knew what I was going to have as a finished product and that this can be upgraded and changed as I see fit in the future. It gave me a very good understanding of react.
